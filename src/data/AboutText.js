They predominantly work in painting, drawing, and sculpture, oftentimes thinking of ways to merge their applications into one. From
an immigrant household in the temperate suburbs of Maryland, they developed an affinity for the landscape as an image that holds command
over our ideas of personhood, origins, and material reality. Depictions of enclosed spaces and open skies come together to create
picturesque scenes that begin to dissolve out of imagination as they erode at their edges. In reinvesting in the "natural" as a visual
fallacy, they hope to meaningfully observe estrangement, idleness, and self-autonomy in an age where the marginalized find themselves
existing like ghosts in plain sight.`

        anxieties of the chaos that surrounds him, which brings him to believe that to "wrest the object of the external world out of its
        natural context" and shed it of all semblances of meaning, will thereby bring him relief. A form with "no smells, no noises, no
        color; no changing from one state to another and the uncertainty that comes with it." I don't find this understanding to be as
        useful in the context cesspool we live in today. Inanimate aesthetic (love) as a form of self-activation may cost us our humanity,
        but a socially-contingent livelihood as we know it is no humanity at all! (Who cares for the unsalvageable?) The marginalized
        suffer in hypervisibility and yet the persuasian of an unseen, unalivable state of being is at the heart of objectification - this
        contradiction has led us to the subject/object conundrum, ornamentalism has bloomed in its wake, and the object is now our flesh.`,

        grander and ever-omnipresent. "It [is miraculous]: a miracle is always a sudden transfomration of nature...it is less a thing than a 
        trace of movement." We must conjure sense from rejection, negative meaning, association folding into association — where we are "richer

        flexing instead.`,
