        description: `Wayside Re-turns is an exploration of architectural forms in collage and collapse": their complacencies,
        social-bindings, and emotional effect to the human eye. Its sense of direction is sprawling, desolate, and still. Despite this,
        our present day may very well reflect the philosophy of purpose, time, and progree shared by the Donkey Ride, an icon commonly
        found in classical Chinese landscape painting, whose journey is guaranteed and destiantion forthcoming. The path winding into
        obscurity, the future unclear and the mountain fading out of sight. Ahead is an obsolete stage with yet a playfully autonomous
        donkey, and perhaps us as its un(fore)seen rider.`,
